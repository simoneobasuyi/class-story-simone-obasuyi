      <div class="right-column">Shoppers meandered through NorthPark Center. Some carried big red Macy’s bags that proclaimed, in bold white script, “Believe.” But Casen Hagans, 11, wasn’t sure he should.
        In line to see Santa Claus, Casen turned to his mother and quietly expressed concern.
        “You sure this is the real deal?”
        He’s in fifth grade, and in a few Christmases, he’ll be taller than his mother. His green-and-black striped sweater matched his little brother’s. The sleeves were just a little too long.
        Casen’s mother assured him this was, in fact, the Santa, while his 7-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister peeked around the corner to get a glimpse of the Big Man.

        Casen still had questions.
        Shouldn’t Santa be at his workshop at this time in December? How is he getting his work done?
        How does he get around the world in one night? Sure, he has flying reindeer, but still...
        A velvet rope was unclipped, and Casen stepped toward the man with the bushy white beard and twinkling blue eyes.
        Belief ... and bicycles
        This year, Casen wrote his list in red marker on a piece of white paper with a festive red-and-white border. He held it in his right hand while sitting next to Santa. He still had doubts — “about 50/50,” he would later say — but the old man’s warm smile and bright eyes conveyed a certain magic of their own.
        He asked for Texas Tech football tickets and a kicking tee, but what he really wants is a new bicycle, the grown-up kind with gears.
        Santa waved goodbye and wished the family a Merry Christmas. He carefully placed the letters from Casen and his siblings in a side table. Casen and his family ran off to continue their shopping at the Disney Store.
        As they walked away, Casen looked toward the sparkling sign outside Macy’s: “Believe.” He hoped Santa got the message: A bike with gears, please.</div>
